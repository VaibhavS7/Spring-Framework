# Spring-Framework

Spring is an open-source framework that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. The core module of Spring, also known as the "Spring Core" module, is at the heart of the framework and provides the fundamental functionality for dependency injection (DI), inversion of control (IoC) and Bean Scopes.

### Overview of versions of Spring Framework
  - Spring 2.5 (2007): support for annotations was introduced, reducing the need for XML configurations.
  - Spring 3.0 (2009): Introduction of Spring Expression language, profile for environment-specific configurations.
  - Spring 4.0 (2013): Added support for Java 8, and introduced Spring Websocket module.
  - Spring 5.0 (2017): Added Spring WebFlux module for reactive programming, Supports Kotlin development.
  - Spring 6.0 (2022): Adopted Java 17, Jakarta EE 9+, and enhanced support for cloud-native and reactive applications.
  - Spring 6.1 (2023): Improved performance, refinements in AOT processing, and optimizations for native images.
  - Spring 6.2 (2024): Further enhancements to cloud integration, modularization improvements, and better support for virtual threads.

### Features of Spring Framework
- Modular Design
- Dependency Injection
- Aspect-oriented programming
- Transaction management
- Data access
- Model-View-Controller(MVC)
- Web development
- Testing
- Spring Cloud

### Advantages of Spring Boot:

- ***Reduced configuration:*** Reduces XML configuration files, making development configuration easy.
- ***Easy to Maintain:*** Loose coupling, separation of concerns, and cleaner code structure.
- ***Automatic configuration:*** Automatically configures beans and management of dependencies.
- ***Embedded server:*** Tomcat is a built-in server that reduces the effort for separate server configuration.
- ***Starter POMs:*** Provides pre-configured starter POMs that simplify dependency management.
- ***Rapid application development:*** Enables rapid application development by simplifying the development process and reducing configuration overhead.
- ***Cloud-friendly:*** Best choice for cloud deployment with support across various cloud platforms.
- ***Security:*** Dedicated security framework, built-in authentication and authorization, and data protection features.
